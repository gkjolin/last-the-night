Dialogue
========

Exploring the galaxy, it was an uneventful evening, but then...
What on ..... earth? Nothing made any sense.
What happened to my ship, where's my co-pilot?
Who knows what wretched planet I crashed on.
The world just stopped, and there was only noise.
Had it been minutes, hours, or days? Time had lost all meaning.
Did I ever leave the spaceship? Am I just a ghost?
Goodbye.
