Android Mice/Gamepad Findings:
==============================

* Google Cardboard Unity Games are really easy to make: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Vrx57RVTjwI
* Android supports mice and gamepads since honeycomb: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-3.1-highlights.html
* It's impossible to hide the mouse cursor pre-nougat stock android: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7954731/3990396
* My S5 is never going to get nougat officially: https://www.androidpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-android-manual-installation
* Wii controllers WILL NOT work, and HAVE NOT worked since 4.2, WiiU Controllers/Joycons SHOULD work: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2381953
* Our PS3 controllers SHOULD work with root, but have both died. PS4 controllers SHOULD work: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dancingpixelstudios.sixaxiscompatibilitychecker
* Wired Xbox360 controllers DO WORK with the following binds: https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/xbox-360-controller-with-android-honeycomb-and-above.143034/
* Old wireless Xbox 360 controllers WILL NOT WORK without a dongle, Wireless Scorpio controllers have bluetooth support: http://theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/23/13030250/new-xbox-wireless-controller-bluetooth-minecraft-gear-vr
* Steam controllers act as a mouse and keyboard: https://reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/46fe2x/has_any_one_been_able_to_connect_the_steam/

TL;DR: PS3 controllers PROBABLY need their batteries replaced at £5 each (Not doing it), Wired Xbox360 with USB OTG cable, or buy a bluetooth controller (Scorpio/Six Axis/Switch/Generic)

Screen Sharing Findings:
========================

* My S5 supports screensharing to pcs (win10 aniversary) and tvs via miracast. Over 2.4GHz there is noticable lag, my laptop doesn't support 5.0GHz
* Regardless of the technology, casting the screen reduces game performance and might cause motion sickness
* MHL requires a cable and therefor is a no-go, we don't want to tether the player to a desktop

TL;DR: Miracast works but is horribly laggy, MHL requires a cable, better idea to just run two instances of the game!
